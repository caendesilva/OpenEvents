OpenEvents is a free, open-source analytics platform that helps you track your events and get insights into your data.

What makes the platform different is that the data you collect is open as well. All metrics tied to your account are public.

This requires you to be transparent about the analytics data you collect. You also need to make a conscious effort not to collect any sensitive data. I believe this helps build trust with your users.

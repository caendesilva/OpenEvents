OpenEvents is currently in beta and is not ready for production use. Since many features are still not implemented, and API endpoints may change at any time, registrations are closed.

You can request an account by opening a ticket at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/caendesilva/OpenEvents) if you understand the risks and want to help improve OpenEvents. This is also where you can report bugs, send feedback, and request features.

Since the platform is open source, you can also contribute to the project by making a pull request.

My ambition is for this service to be completely free for personal and non-revenue generating open source projects.

I plan to make the server costs public in hopes of crowdfunding the service among those who can and want to pay.

I may need to add storage limits for free accounts. As of now, the service is free for commercial projects as well, but in the future, I think that commercial projects pay per storage/usage after hitting a generous free tier.

Since the platform is open-source you can always self-host it for free.

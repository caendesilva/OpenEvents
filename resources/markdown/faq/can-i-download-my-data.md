Absolutely!

Planned features are:
- Export of event data to JSON, CSV, HTML, etc.
- Import of event data through JSON.
- Bulk deletion of data.

Another feature planned is bulk event dispatching. For example, instead of making API requests for each event, you can backdate events and dispatch them all at once or in batches to reduce the number of API calls and save network bandwidth and computing costs.

As it is now, if you are using a framework like Laravel, you can queue the event dispatching jobs to be run in the background instead of impacting the user experience.

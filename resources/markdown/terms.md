# Terms of Service

> OpenEvents is currently in beta and comes with no warranties or guarantees whatsoever.

## About
OpenEvents is currently in beta. The platform was created as a practice project to get practical knowledge of working with Laravel APIs and SaaS platforms.

If there is real interest in this platform I hope to keep the hosted version free for non-revenue generating projects such as personal and open source projects. But I may need to ask for donations to cover server costs or implement a paid plan for commercial use.

The platform will always be open source and can be self-hosted.

## Get access
Registrations are currently closed as the platform is too new to bring any kind of guarantees in terms of API endpoint stability and integrations. If you are interested in trying it out, please contact me and I'll give you an account. Just know that things may break at any time.

## Terms
I reserve the right to block users who do not use the platform in good faith. I appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose their findings (see GitHub for instructions). However, deliberate abuse of the platform including but not limited to spam, flooding, etc, is not tolerated.

## Privacy
Projects are not allowed to include personally identifiable information in event data.
Repeat violations will result in the account being closed. 

See the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy) for more information.

## Warranty
The platform is provided "as is" without a warranty of any kind. During the beta phase API endpoints may change without notice. I am not responsible for any damage caused by the use of this platform. These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time without notice.

## Disclaimer
I am a developer and a student, not a lawyer. This is a project for practice and education that I am making in my spare time and for fun. I'm acting in good faith, and hope that you are too.

## Legal disclaimer

OpenEvents makes no warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. OpenEvents does not warrant that the API, service, or code is error-free or that access to the API, service, or code will be uninterrupted or error-free. OpenEvents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or other damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from the use of or inability to use the API, service, or code, even if OpenEvents has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

# Using the Pixel

## âš  This feature is experimental and may be removed without notice.

## About
The Pixel is an image that can be used to dispatch events from your frontend without using an API.

You use the pixel by adding an `<img>` tag to your page and setting the `src` attribute to the URL of the pixel combined with the event name as a query parameter.

Example:
```html
<img src="https://openevents.test/api/projects/andromeda/pixel?event=page_view">
```

## Supplying data
Data is supplied using URL parameters attached to the pixel image source URI.

You must supply an event name up to 32 characters and you can supply a data payload string (supports JSON) up to 32 characters.

The reason the data field is shorter is because some data is generated on the server-side.

For example, supplying the following query parameters:
```curl
pixel?event=page_view&data={"page":"about-us"}
```

Will result in an event will the following data:
```json
{"origin":"pixel","data":{"page":"about-us"},"context":{"request_pineprint":"hypergiant-quaoar-sombrero"}}
```


However, if the user has a DNT (Do Not Track) header set, the following will be saved instead:

```json
{"origin":"pixel","data":{"page":"about-us"},"context":"Request has DNT header. No context data is collected."}
```

Full example:
```html
<img src='https://openevents.test/api/projects/andromeda/pixel?event=page_view&data={"page":"about-us"}' width="1" height="1" alt="" role="none">
```

## Not like other Pixels
The OpenEvents Pixel is not like other Pixels.

First, it never stores any personal data nor does it use any tracking data.

The only identifier collected is a `request_pineprint` which is a form of checksum that is generated by the OpenEvents API server. The pineprint can be used to see if multiple requests are coming from the same user, **however** it is not possible to identify the user by the pineprint and the pineprint changes completely if the event name or data changes. 

For example: The following event data `?event=page_view&data=page-about-us` will result in the following pineprint: `"browndwarf-jupiter-bode"`.
Change the page to `?event=page_view&data=page-index` and the pineprint is: `uranus-milkyway`. If the user has a DNT header, no pineprint is generated.

This for example makes it useful when counting page visits, to see how many unique users visit the site.

# The OpenEvents Platform

## About
OpenEvents is a free Event-Driven Analytics Platform offering fully transparent and open-source analytics.

It is planned to be free for personal and open source projects.

## How does it work?
OpenEvents is an API-based analytics service that helps you track your events and get insights into your data.

What makes the platform different is that the data you collect is open as well. All metrics tied to your account are public.

This requires you to be transparent about the analytics data you collect. You also need to make a conscious effort not to collect any sensitive data. I believe this helps build trust with your users.

# The OpenEvents Platform

## About
OpenEvents is a free Event-Driven Analytics Platform offering fully transparent and open-source analytics.

It is planned to be free for personal and open source projects.

## How does it work?
OpenEvents is an API-based analytics service that helps you track your events and get insights into your data.

What makes the platform different is that the data you collect is open as well. All metrics tied to your account are public.

This requires you to be transparent about the analytics data you collect. You also need to make a conscious effort not to collect any sensitive data. I believe this helps build trust with your users.

## What problem does it solve?
Let's face it: analytics suck. They really do. As developers, we want to be able to understand how the stuff we build work and perform. But as privacy-minded individuals who care about our users, we don't feel comfortable with giving services like "certain analytics platforms" access to the personal data of our users, making both us and them the product in the process.

> Note that I am using the term "we" here when I am definitely talking about myself.

So let's solve this together! There are already analytics platforms that claim to care about user privacy. And they probably do. But should our end users take their word on it (and ours for that matter?

OpenEvents forces projects using it to be fully transparent about exactly what data they collect. Developers must also make a conscious effort to not include any personal information.

My hope is to keep the hosted version of this free for personal and non-revenue generating projects. This is just a side project of mine that I started as a way to practise working with APIs and SaaS platforms. But if it has value to people I'd love to be able to crowdfund the server costs. You can also buy me a coffee if this project helped you! https://www.buymeacoffee.com/caen
